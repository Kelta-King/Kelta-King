Welcome! I'm a software engineer specializing in website and Android app development, along with maintaining and enhancing operating services. Skilled in Node.js, PHP, Python, Express.js, and React.js, I create seamless web experiences. As a full-stack developer, I work on both frontend and backend aspects, ensuring smooth functionality.

In Android app development, I use React Native to craft engaging mobile experiences. My expertise also extends to operating systems, where I excel in C++. With six years of programming language experience and two years of professional work, I've built various applications, including chat apps, patient management systems, and blogging platforms. Notably, I developed an online exam system accommodating 1300 simultaneous students.

Beyond work, I enjoy playing cricket, painting, and participating in social welfare programs like cleaning gardens and teaching underprivileged children. Let's connect and explore the world of technology together!
